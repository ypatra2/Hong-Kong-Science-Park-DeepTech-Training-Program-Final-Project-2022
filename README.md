# Hong Kong Science Park DeepTech Training Program Final Project 2022
 
This project was my final submission for the Hong Kong Science Park DeepTech Training Program 2022. It is a Transfer Learning model that uses the VGG16 CNN architecture using the dataset provided below, to be able to tell apart different fruits and ascertain their freshness.

**[Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FKSFTex7gbbSnpIhvMMM2hEOREb5-UtV?usp=sharing)**

The dataset comes from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sriramr/fruits-fresh-and-rotten-for-classification)**. The dataset is in the `fruits` folder. There are 6 categories of fruits: fresh apples, fresh oranges, fresh bananas, rotten apples, rotten oranges, and rotten bananas.

There are two folders - "train" and "valid" which contain 6 sub-folders namely, "freshapples", "freshbanana", "freshoranges" and "rottenapples", "rottenbanana", "rottenoranges".
